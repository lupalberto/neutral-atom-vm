# Ticket: Backend Optimization

- **Priority:** Low
- **Status:** Superseded

## Summary
Refocused into the broader “advanced backends / multi-backend” work (see `.tracker/advanced-backends.md` and the roadmap Phase 5 bullet on multi-backend support), so this ticket is now superseded.

## Notes
- The original goal—adding pluggable high-performance engines (GPU/statevector, tensor network, fast Clifford)—is still captured by the `advanced-backends`/Phase 5 items, so no separate effort is necessary here anymore.
