  <h3>About this project</h3>
  <p>
    This Neutral Atom VM prototype was built over a focused weekend
    to explore QuEra’s public material, learn the neutral-atom VM
    problem space, and mirror the responsibilities in the Scientific
    Software Engineer role.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is not to ship production-ready code, but to show how I
    work: ramping up quickly on a new domain, sketching and refining
    an architecture, building a vertical slice end to end, and
    documenting decisions so others can follow the reasoning.
  </p>
  <p>
    On this page (<strong>{pageLabel}</strong>), you are seeing one facet of
    that process: how I think about layers and contracts, developer
    ergonomics, noise/QEC modeling, and the details that make a system
    feel like real hardware to its users.
